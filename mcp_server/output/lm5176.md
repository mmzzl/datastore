Connect to the power stage output rail Input or output current sense amplifier inputs. An optional current sense resistor connected between ISNS(+) and ISNS( - ) can be located either on the input side or on the output ISNS(- ) 13 10 side of the converter. If the sensed voltage across the ISNS(+) and ISNS(-) pins reaches ISNS(+) 14 11 50 mV, a slow constant current (CC) control loop becomes active and starts discharging the soft-start capacitor to regulate the drop across ISNS(+) and ISNS( - ) to 50 mV. Short ISNS(+) and ISNS( - ) together to disable this feature. CSG 15 12 The negative or ground input to the PWM current sense amplifier. Connect directly to the low-side (ground) of the current sense resistor. cs 16 13 The positive input to the PWM current sense amplifier PGOOD 17 14 Power-Good open drain output. PGOOD is pulled low when FB is outside a -9%/+10% regulation window around the 0.8-V Vper. Sw2 18 15 Swi 28 25 The boost and the buck side switching nodes, respectively. HDRV2 19 16 Output of the high-side gate drivers. Connect directly to the gates of the high-side HDRV1 27 24 MOSFETs. BOOT2 20 17 An external capacitor is required between the BOOT1, BOOT2 pins and the SW1, SW2 BOOT1 26 23 pins respectively to provide bias to the high-side MOSFET gate drivers. LDRV2 21 18 6) Output of the low-side gate drivers. Connect directly to the gates of the low-side LDRV1 25 22 MOSFETs. PGND 22 19 G Power ground of the IC. The high current ground connection to the low-side gate drivers Vcc 23 20 O/P Output of the VCC bias regulator. Connect capacitor to ground. Optional input to the VCC bias regulator. Powering VCC from an external supply instead of BIAS 24 21 /P Vin can reduce power loss at high Viy. For Vgias > 8 V, the VCC regulator draws power from the BIAS pin. PowerPAD™ Solder the PowerPAD to the analog ground. If possible, use thermal vias to connect to a PCB ground plane for improved power dissipation. 4 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Product Folder Links: LM5176

[?\ TEXAS INSTRUMENTS LM5176 www.ti.com.cn ZHCSGN6D - JUNE 2017 - REVISED AUGUST 2021 7 Detailed Description 7.1 Overview The LM5176 is a wide input voltage four-switch buck-boost controller IC with integrated drivers for N-channel MOSFETs. It operates in buck mode when is greater than Voyr and in boost mode when Vix is less than Vout. When Vin is close to Vout, the device operates in a proprietary transition buck or boost mode. The control scheme provides smooth operation for any input/output combination within the specified operating range. The buck or boost transition control scheme provides a low ripple output voltage when Vij equals Voyt without compromising the efficiency. The LM5176 integrates four N-Channel MOSFET drivers including two low-side drivers and two high-side drivers, eliminating the need for external drivers or floating bias supplies. The internal VCC regulator supplies internal bias rails as well as the MOSFET gate drivers. The VCC regulator is powered either from the input voltage through the VIN pin or from the output or an external supply through the BIAS pin for improved efficiency. The PWM control scheme is based on valley current mode control for buck operation and peak current mode conirol for boost operation. The inductor current is sensed through a single sense resistor in series with the low- side MOSFETs. The sensed current is also monitored for cycle-by-cycle current limit. The behavior of the LM5176 during an overload condition is dependent on the MODE pin programming (see the 77 7.4.2 section). If hiccup mode fault protection is selected, the controller turns off after a fixed number of switching cycles in cycle- by-cycle current limit and restarts after another fixed number of clock cycles. The hiccup mode reduces the heating in the power components in a sustained overload condition. If hiccup mode is disabled through the MODE pin, the controller remains in a cycle-by-cycle current limit condition until the overload is removed. In addition to the cycle-by-cycle current limiting, the LM5176 also provides an optional average current regulation loop that can be configured for either input or output current limiting. This is useful for battery charging or other applications where a constant current behavior may be required. The soft-start time of LM5176 is programmed by a capacitor connected to the SS pin to minimize the inrush current and overshoot during start-up. The precision EN/UVLO pin supporis programmable input undervoltage lockout (UVLO) with hysteresis. The output overvoltage protection (OVP) feature turns off the high-side drivers when the voltage at the FB pin exceeds ihe output overvoltage threshold (Voyp). The PGOOD output indicates when the FB voltage is inside the PGOOD regulation window centered at Vper.

The output voltage, scaled down by the feedback resistor divider, appears at the FB pin and is compared to the internal reference (Vref) by an internal error amplifier. The error amplifier produces an error voltage by driving the COMP pin. An adaptive slope compensation signal based on Vin, Vout, and the capacitor at the SLOPE pin is added to the current sense signal measured across the CS and CSG pins. The result is compared to the COMP error voltage by the PWM comparator. The LM5176 regulates the output using valley current mode control in buck mode and peak current mode conirol in boost mode. For valley current mode control, the high-side buck MOSFET controlled by HDRV1 is turned on by the PWM comparator at the valley of the inductor ripple current and turned off by the oscillator clock signal. Valley current mode control is advantageous for buck converters where the PWM controller must resolve very short on-times.

The low-side gate drive, LDRV1, complementary to the HDRV1 drive signal, controls the synchronous rectification MOSFET of the buck stage. The high-side gate drive, HDRV2, complementary to the low-side gate drive LDRV2, controls the high-side synchronous rectifier of the boost stage. For operation with close to Vout, the LM5176 uses a proprietary buck or boost transition scheme to achieve smooth, low ripple transition zone behavior. Peak and valley current mode controllers require slope compensation for stable current loop operation at duty cycle greater than 50% in peak current mode conirol and less than 50% in valley current mode conirol. The LM5176 provides a SLOPE pin to program optimum slope for any Vij and Voyr combination using an external capacitor. 7.3.2 VCC Regulator and Optional BIAS Input The VCC regulator provides a regulated bias supply to the gate drivers. When EN/UVLO is above the standby threshold (VenstByy), the VCC regulator is turned on. For less than the VCC regulation target, the VCC voltage tracks Viy with a small voltage drop as shown in | 6-4. If the EN/UVLO input is above the operating threshold and VCC exceeds the VCC UV threshold (Vyvvcc)), the controller is enabled and switching begins.     The VCC regulator draws power from when there is no supply voltage connected to the BIAS pin. If the BIAS pin is connected to an external voltage source that exceeds VCC by one diode drop, the VCC regulator draws power from the BIAS input instead of Vjy. Connecting the BIAS pin to in applications with Voyr greater than 8.5 V improves the efficiency of the regulator in the buck mode. For low Vin operation, ensure that the VCC voltage is sufficient to fully enhance the MOSFETs. Use an external bias supply if Viy dips below the voltage required to sustain the VCC voltage. For these conditions, use a series blocking diode between the input supply and the VIN pin (AJ 7-1). This prevents VCC from back-feeding into Vin through the body diode of the VCC regulator.     A ceramic capacitor of 16 V or higher voltage rating and a value between 1 UF and 4.7 UF is required to supply the VCC regulator load transients. The VCC bypass capacitor should be connected between VCC and PGND pins. Series Blocking Diode VIN > ° VIN Cun 7 LM5176     Optional Bias Supply/ VOUT BIAS vec | 7-1.

The EN/UVLO pin has three distinct voltage ranges: shutdown, standby, and operating (see 7 7.4.1). When the EN/UVLO pin is below the standby threshold, the converter is held in a low power shutdown mode.

When EN/UVLO is greater than the operating threshold, Vencop), and VCC is above the undervoltage threshold, Vyyvcc), the controller starts operation. A hysteresis current A lyysiop) is sourced out of the EN/UVLO pin when the EN/UVLO input exceeds the operating threshold to provide hysteresis that prevents on/off chattering in the presence of noise with a slowly changing input voltage. The Vix UVLO threshold is typically set by a resistor divider from Vij to AGND 7-2). The turnon threshold Vincuvy is calculated using 1 where Ryy2 is the upper resistor and Ryy, is the lower resistor in the EN/ UVLO resistor divider: Ruve = Vencop) x} 1+ Rt Ruve Uv1 (1) The hysteresis between the UVLO turnon threshold and turnoff threshold is set by the upper resistor in the EN/ UVLO resistor divider and is given by: AVuys(uv) = Aluysop) x Ruve (2) Vin LM5176 Ruvz EN/UVLO Ruvi Aj 7-2. UVLO Threshold Programming 7.3.4 Soft Start The LM5176 soft-start time is programmed using a soft-start capacitor from the SS pin to AGND. When the converter is enabled, an internal current source (Igs) charges the soft-start capacitor. When the SS pin voltage is below the feedback reference voltage, the soft-start pin controls the regulated FB voltage. Once SS exceeds Vre_er, the soft-start interval is complete and the error amplifier is referenced to Vper. The soft-start time is given by 3: 1 - Uss* Vee ss | Ss (3) The soft-start capacitor is internally discharged when the converter is disabled because of EN/UVLO falling below the operating threshold or VCC falling below the VCC UV threshold. The soft-start pin is also discharged when the converter is in hiccup mode current limiting or in thermal shutdown. When average input or output current limiting is active, the soft-start capacitor is discharged by the constant current loop transconductance (gm) amplifier to limit either input or output current. 7.3.5 Overcurrent Protection The LM5176 provides cycle-by-cycle current limit to protect against overcurrent and short circuit conditions. In buck operation, the sensed valley voltage across the CSG and CS pins is limited to Vespuck). The high-side buck switch skips a cycle if the sensed voltage does not fall below this threshold during the buck switch off time. In boost operation, the maximum peak voltage across CS and CSG is limited to Vesgoosr). If the peak current in the low-side boost switch causes the voltage across CS and CSG to exceed this threshold voltage, the boost switch is turned off for the remainder of the clock cycle. 16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Product Folder Links: LM5176

[?\ TEXAS INSTRUMENTS LM5176 www.ti.com.cn ZHCSGN6D - JUNE 2017 - REVISED AUGUST 2021 Applying the appropriate voltage to the MODE pin of the LM5176 enables hiccup mode fault protection (see 7 7.4.2). In hiccup mode, the coniroller shuts down after detecting cycle-by-cycle current limiting for 128 consecutive cycles and the soft-start capacitor is discharged. The soft-start capacitor is automatically released after 4000 oscillator clock cycles and the controller restarts. If hiccup mode protection is not enabled through the MODE pin, the LM5176 will operate in cycle-by-cycle current limiting as long as the overload condition persists. 7.3.6 Average Input/Output Current Limiting The LM5176 provides optional average current limiting capability to limit either the input or the output current of the DC/DC converter. The average current limiting circuit uses an additional current sense resistor connected in series with the input supply or output voltage of the converter. A current sense gm amplifier with inputs at the ISNS(+) and ISNS(-) pins monitors the voltage across the sense resistor and compares it with an internal 50-mV reference. If the drop across the sense resistor is greater than 50 mV, the gm amplifier gradually discharges the soft-start capacitor. When the sofi-start capacitor discharges below the feedback reference voltage, Vref, the output voltage of the converter decreases to limit the input or output current. The average current limiting feature can be used in applications requiring a regulated current from the input supply or into the load. The target constant current is given by 77FExt 4: 50 mV IoL(AvG) = Rens   (4)   A filter network as shown in 8] 8-1 is often used across the ISNS(+) and ISNS(-) pins to filter the ripple in the average current sense signal.   The average current loop can be disabled by shorting the ISNS(+) and ISNS(-) pins together to AGND. 7.3.7 Operation Above 40-V Input For application where input voltage is higher than 40 V, a 2-k2 resistor in series with the VISNS pin is required as shown in 8-1. 7.3.8 CCM Operation The LM5176 works in continuous conduction mode (CCM). In CCM operation, the inductor current can flow in either direction and the controller switches at a fixed frequency regardless of the load current. The CCM operation is useful for noise-sensitive applications where a fixed switching eases filter design. 7.3.9 Frequency and Synchronization (RT/SYNC) The LM5176 switching frequency can be programmed between 100 kHz and 600 kHz using a resistor from the RT/SYNC pin to AGND. The Ry resistor is related to the nominal switching frequency (Fey) by 5: [= |-190 ns R _ Few 116 pF (5)       4| 6-3 in the 7 6.6 shows the relationship between the programmed switching frequency (Fs) and the Ry resistor. The RT/SYNC pin can also be used to synchronize the internal oscillator to an external clock signal. The external synchronization pulse is ac coupled using a capacitor to the RT/SYNC pin. The external synchronization pulse frequency range is 75% to 125% of the resistor programmed frequency. A 50% duty cycle is acceptable for external SYNC.

A triangular waveform centered at 1.22 V is generated across the Cprty capacitor. This triangular waveform modulates the oscillator frequency by 10% of the nominal frequency set by the Ry resistor. The Cpt capacitance value sets the rate of the low frequency modulation. A lower Cp)ty Capacitance will modulate the oscillator frequency at a faster rate than a higher capacitance. For the dithering circuit to effectively reduce peak EMI, the modulation rate must be much less than the oscillator frequency (Fey). 6 calculates the DITH pin capacitance required to set the modulation frequency, Fyop. Connecting the DITH pin directly to AGND disables frequency dithering, and the internal oscillator operates at a fixed frequency set by the RT resistor.

Each driver is capable of sourcing 1.8-A and sinking 2.2-A peak current. In buck operation, LDRV1 and HDRV1 are switched by the PWM controller while HDRV2 remains continuously on. In boost operation, LDRV2 and HDRV2 are switched while HDRV1 remains continuously on. The low-side gate drivers are powered from VCC and the high-side gate drivers HDRV1 and HDRV2 are powered from bootstrap capacitors Cgoot; (between BOOT1 and SW1) and Cgoot2 (between BOOT2 and SW2), respectively. The and Capacitors are charged through external Schottky diodes connecied to the VCC pin as shown in 8] 8-1. In most applications, ceramic capacitors of 16-V or higher voltage rating and values between 0.1 UF and 0.22 UF are sufficient for Cpgot1 and 7.3.15 Thermal Shutdown The LM5176 is protected by a thermal shutdown circuit that shuts down the device when the internal junction temperature exceeds 165°C (typical). The soft-start capacitor is discharged when thermal shutdown is triggered and the gate drivers are disabled. The converter automatically restarts when the junction temperature drops by the thermal shutdown hysteresis of 15°C below the thermal shutdown threshold. 7.4 Device Functional Modes Refer to 77 7.3.3 for the description of EN/UVLO pin function. 77 7.4.7 lists the shutdown, standby, and operating modes for LM5176 as a function of EN/UVLO and VCC voltages.

Choosing a larger inductance reduces the ripple current but also increases the size of the inductor. A larger inductor also reduces the achievable bandwidth of the converter by moving the right half plane zero to lower frequencies. Therefore, a judicious compromise should be made based on the application requirements. For this design a 4.7-uH inductor is selected. With this inductor selection, the inductor current ripple is 6.5 A, 4.3 A, and at Vix of 50 V, 24 V, and 6 V, respectively.

For the buck operation, the current limit resistor is given by: 80 mV = =13mQ RsENSE(BUCK) louT(MAX) (23) For the boost mode of operation, the current limit resistor is given by: = 20 mV =8.3mO RsENSE(B0OST) L(PEAK) (24) The closest standard value of Rsense = 8 mQ is selected based on the boost mode operation. The maximum power dissipation in Rgense happens at Vinquiny: 120mV __YIN(MIN) PRSENSE(MAX) = RseNsE OUT J-o9w (25) Therefore, a sense resistor with 2-W power rating will be sufficient for this application. For some application circuits, it can be required to add a filter network to attenuate noise in the CS and CSG sense lines. See | 8-1 for typical values. The filter resistance should not exceed 100 ©. 8.2.2.8 Slope Compensation For stable current loop operation and to avoid subharmonic oscillations, the slope capacitor should be selected based on 77Fzz 26: { S 4.7 Cg ope = IMg_opE x 8maQx5 = 235 pF Rsense X Acs (26) This slope compensation results in “dead-beat” operation, in which the current loop disturbances die out in one switching cycle. Theoretically, a current mode loop is stable with half the “dead-beat” slope (twice the calculated slope capacitor value in 26).

A larger slope signal, however, restricts the achievable input voltage range for a given output voltage, switching frequency, and inductor. For this design, Cs_ope = 220 pF is selected for better transition region behavior while still providing the required Vij range. This selection of slope capacitor, inductor, switching frequency, and inductor satisfies the COMP range limitation explained in 7 7.3.13. 8.2.2.9 UVLO The UVLO resistor divider must be designed for turnon below 6 V. Selecting Ryy2 = 249 kQ gives a UVLO hysteresis of 0.8 V based on 77 #270 2. The lower UVLO resistor is the selected using W##s% 27: Ruvi = Ruve * VEN(OP) Vincuv) + lenrstay) * Ruv2 — Venop) (27) A standard value of 59.0 k® is selected for Ryy1. When programming the UVLO threshold for lower input voltage operation, it is important to choose MOSFETs with gate (Miller) plateau voltage lower than the minimum Vjy. 8.2.2.10 Soft-Start Capacitor The soft-start time is programmed using the soft-start capacitor. The relationship between Cgg and the soft-start time is given by: 1 - Uss* Vee $s Isg (28) Csg = 0.1 UF gives a soft-start time of 16 ms. 8.2.2.11 Dither Capacitor The dither capacitor sets the modulation frequency of the frequency dithering around the nominal switching frequency. A larger Corry results in lower modulation frequency. For proper operation, the modulation frequency (Fuop) must be much lower than the switching frequency. Use 29 to select for the target modulation frequency. 10 pA Coty = Fulop x 0.24 V (29) For the current design, dithering is not being implemented. Therefore, a 0-Q resistor from the DITH pin to AGND disables this feature. 8.2.2.12 MOSFETs QH1 and QL1 The input side MOSFETs QH1 and QL1 need to withstand the maximum input voltage of 50 V. In addition, they must withstand the transient spikes at SW1 during switching. Therefore, QH1 and QL1 should be rated for 60 V or higher. The gate plateau voltages of the MOSFETs should be smaller than the minimum input voltage of the converter, otherwise the MOSFETs may not fully enhance during start-up or overload conditions. The power loss in QH1 in the boost mode of operation is approximated by: PCOND(QH1) = fou } ‘Roson(QHt) (30) The power loss in QH1 in buck mode of operation consists of both conduction and switching loss components given by 31 and 32, respectively: Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25 Product Folder Links: LM5176

The LM5176 operates mainly in buck or boost modes, separated by a transition region, and therefore, the control loop design is done for both buck and boost operating modes. Then, a final selection of compensation is made based on the mode that is more restrictive from a loop stability point of view. Typically, for a converter designed to go deep into both buck and boost operating regions, the boost compensation design is more restrictive due to the presence of a right half plane zero (RHPZ) in the boost mode.

The buck power stage output pole location is given by: 1 { = On | Rout * Cour ] (41) The buck power stage ESR zero location is the same as the boost power stage ESR zero Itis clear from 40 that RHP zero is the main factor limiting the achievable bandwidth. For a robust design, the crossover frequency should be less than 1/3 of the RHP zero frequency. Given the position of the RHP zero, a reasonable target bandwidth in boost operation is around 4 kHz: fow = 4 kHz (42) For some power stages, the boost RHP zero might not be as restrictive. This happens when the boost maximum duty cycle (Diyax) is small, or when a really small inductor is used. In those cases, compare the limits posed by the RHP zero (fryp / 3) with 1/20 of the switching frequency and use the smaller of the two values as the achievable bandwidth. The compensation zero can be placed at 1.5 times the boost output pole frequency. Keep in mind that this locates the zero at three times the buck output pole frequency which results in approximately 30 degrees of phase loss before crossover of the buck loop and 15 degrees of phase loss at intermediate frequencies for the boost loop: fro = 600 Hz (43) If the crossover frequency is well below the RHP zero and the compensation zero is placed well below the crossover, the compensation gain resistor, R,,, is calculated using the approximation: cl _ 20% fow , Resi +Repe , Acs <Rsense XCout _ 9 ag Kg Rept 1- Dax (44) where Dyax is the maximum duty cycle at the minimum in boost mode and Agzg is the current sense amplifier gain.

o TEXAS LM5176 INSTRUMENTS ZHCSGN6D - JUNE 2017 - REVISED AUGUST 2021 www.ti.com.cn 10 Layout 10.1 Layout Guidelines The basic PCB board layout requires separation of sensitive signal and power paths. This checklist must be followed to get good performance for a well designed board. e Place the power components including the input filter capacitor Cjy, the power MOSFETs QL1 and QH1, and the sense resistor Rgenge close together to minimize the loop area for input switching current in buck operation. Place the power components including the output filter capacitor Court, the power MOSFETs QL2 and QH2, and the sense resistor Rgenge close together to minimize the loop area for output switching current in boost operation. Use a combination of bulk capacitors and smaller ceramic capacitors with low series impedance for the input and output capacitors. Place the smaller capacitors closer to the IC to provide a low impedance path for high di/dt switching currents. Minimize the SW1 and SW2 loop areas as these are high dv/dt nodes. Layout the gate drive traces and return paths as directly as possible. Layout the forward and return traces close together, either running side by side or on top of each other on adjacent layers to minimize the inductance of the gate drive path. Use Kelvin connections to Rgenge for the current sense signals CS and CSG and run lines in parallel from the Rgense terminals to the IC pins. Avoid crossing noisy areas such as SW1 and SW2 nodes or high-side gate drive traces. Place the filter capacitor for the current sense signal as close to the IC pins as possible. Place the Cin, Court, and Rsense ground pins as close as possible with thick ground trace and/or planes on multiple layers. Place the VCC bypass capacitor close to the controller IC, between the VCC and PGND pins. A 1-uF ceramic capacitor is typically used. Place the BIAS bypass capacitor close to the controller IC, between the BIAS and PGND pins. A 0.1-pF ceramic capacitor is typically used. Place the BOOT1 bootstrap capacitor close to the IC and connect directly to the BOOT1 to SW1 pins. Place the BOOT2 bootstrap capacitor close to the IC and connect directly to the BOOT2 to SW2 pins. Bypass the V)y pin to AGND with a low ESR ceramic capacitor located close to the controller IC. A 0.1-uF ceramic capacitor is typically used. When using external BIAS, use a diode between input rails and Vij pins to prevent reverse conduction when Vjy < VCC. Connect the feedback resistor divider between the Court positive terminal and AGND pin of the IC. Place the components close to the FB pin. Use care to separate the power and signal paths so that no power or switching current flows through the AGND connections which can either corrupt the COMP, SLOPE, or SYNC signals, or cause dc offset in the FB sense signal. The PGND and AGND traces can be connected near the PGND pin, near the VCC capacitor PGND connection, or near the PGND connection of the CS, CSG pin current sense resistor. When using the average current loop, divide the overall capacitor (Cjj or between the two sides of the sense resistor to ensure small cycle-by-cycle ripple. Place the average current loop filter capacitor close to the IC between the ISNS(+) and ISNS( - ) pins. 30 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Product Folder Links: LM5176
