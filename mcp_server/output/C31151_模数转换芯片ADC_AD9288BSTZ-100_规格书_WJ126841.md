AD9288 THEORY OF OPERATION The AD9288 ADC architecture is a bit-per-stage pipeline-type the input is overdriven. The nominal input range is 1.024 V p-p centered at Vp x 0.3. converter utilizing switch capacitor techniques. These stages determine the 5 MSBs and drive a 3-bit flash. Each stage VOLTAGE REFERENCE provides sufficient overlap and error correction, allowing A stable and accurate 1.25 V voltage reference is built into the optimization of comparator accuracy. The input buffers are AD9288 (REFour). In normal operation, the internal reference differential, and both sets of inputs are internally biased. This is used by strapping Pins 5 (REFwA) and 7 (REFivB) to Pin 6 allows the most flexible use of ac or dc and differential or (REFOUT). The input range can be adjusted by varying the single-ended input modes. The output staging block aligns the reference voltage applied to the AD9288. No appreciable data, carries out the error correction, and feeds the data to degradation in performance occurs when the reference is output buffers. The set of output buffers are powered from a adjusted +5%. The full-scale range of the ADC tracks reference separate supply, allowing adjustment of the output voltage voltage, which changes linearly. swing. There is no discernible difference in performance between the two channels. TIMING USING THE AD9288 The AD9288 provides latched data outputs, with four pipeline delays. Data outputs are available one propagation delay (tren) Good high speed design practices must be followed when after the rising edge of the Encode command (see Figure 2, using the AD9288. To obtain maximum benefit, decoupling Figure 3, and Figure 4). The length of the output data lines and capacitors should be physically as close as possible to the chip, loads placed on them must be minimized to reduce transients minimizing trace and via inductance between chip pins and within the AD9288. These transients can detract from the capacitor (0603 surface-mount capacitors are used on the converter’s dynamic performance. AD9288/PCB evaluation board). It is recommended to place a 0.1 uF capacitor at each power-ground pin pair for high The minimum guaranteed conversion rate of the AD9288 is 1 MSPS. At clock rates below 1 MSPS, dynamic performance frequency decoupling, and to include one 10 uF capacitor for local low frequency decoupling. The VREF IN pin should also degrades. Typical power-up recovery time after standby mode is 15 clock cycles. be decoupled by a 0.1 uF capacitor.

The compatible pinout Each channel can be clocked by a common clock input at SMA of the two parts facilitates the use of one PCB for testing either input ENCODE A/B. The channels can also be clocked part. The PCB requires power supplies, a clock source, and a independently by a simple board modification. The clock input filtered analog source for most ADC testing required. should be a low jitter sine source for maximum performance. POWER CONNECTOR DATA OUTPUTS Power is supplied to the board via a detachable 12-lead power The data outputs are latched on-board by two 10-bit latches and strip. The minimum 3 V supplies required to run the board are drive an 8-pin connector which is compatible with the dual- Vop, Vo1, and Vpp. To allow the use of the optional amplifier channel FIFO board available from Analog Devices. This board, path, +5 V supplies are required. together with ADC analyzer software, can greatly simplify ADC ANALOG INPUTS testing. Each channel has an independent analog path that uses a DATA FORMAT/GAIN wideband transformer to drive the ADC differentially from a The DFS/Gain pin can be biased for desired operation at the DFS single-ended sine source at the input SMAs. The transformer jumper located at the S1, $2 jumpers. paths can be bypassed to allow the use of a dc-coupled path by TIMING using two AD8138 op amps with a simple board modification. Timing on each channel can be controlled if needed on the The analog input should be band-pass filtered to remove any PCB. Clock signals at the latches or the data ready signals that harmonics in the input signal and to minimize aliasing. go to the output 80-pin connector can be inverted if required.
